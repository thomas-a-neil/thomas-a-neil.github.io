Introduces TeleProt, a framework for guiding protein library design with machine learning that leverages evolutionary and experimental data. Validates TeleProt in an enzyme engineering campaign to optimize the endonuclease NucB. Across 4 rounds of data collection, ML-designed libraries show improved hit rate and diversity compared to directed evolution.
